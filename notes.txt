Core Functionalities
--------------------
1. Load & Play Local Files
   * Use <input type="file" accept="audio/*" multiple />
   * Store File objects temporarily (can’t store entire files in localStorage)
   * Use URL.createObjectURL() to play them
   * Store metadata (file name, duration) in IndexedDB/localStorage

2. Recent Files List
   * Save recently accessed filenames with their lastPlayed timestamps in localStorage
   * Sort and display on Home screen

3. Bookmark Current Position
   * Track playback time via audio.currentTime
   * Store positions keyed by file name or a generated hash
   * Update periodically (e.g., every 5–10 seconds)
   * Restore last position on file load

4. Transport Controls
   Implement buttons to skip:
   ⏪ 2s / 10s backward: audio.currentTime -= x
   ⏩ 2s / 10s forward: audio.currentTime += x

5. Chapter List (Manual or File-based)
   * Let user create/edit chapter markers per file (store in localStorage)
   * OR parse embedded chapter metadata if present (M4A supports this, but limited browser support)
   * Display chapter list UI
   * On click: audio.currentTime = chapterTime
